The ministers comments came just a week after OPEC decided to work toward a deal to limit output to a band of between 32.5 million barrels per day and 33 million bpd. Market cheer and euphoric oil price hikes lasted for a few days after OPECs deal-to-reach-a-deal, but the market and analysts were quick to realize|http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Iraqs-Oil-Minister-Calls-For-Increase-In-Output-In-2016-2017.html}2016-10-10 16:11:07.702837|IEA: Global Energy Efficiency Up Amid Oil Price Rout|The worlds energy efficiency rose by 1.8 percent last year despite the oil price crash that saw crude trade at 60 percent lower levels than at its peak in 2014, the International Energy Agency said in a report. The figure represents the improvement in amount of energy used per unit of GDP, which means the global economy needed less energy to expand, the EIA explains in a press release.

This is according to sources close to the two countries, quoted by Reuters.

There is a lot more oil in storage than the amount that can be accounted for by domestic production and imports. Thats a big problem since oil prices move up or down based on the U.S. crude oil storage report. Oil stocks in inventory represent surplus supply.
